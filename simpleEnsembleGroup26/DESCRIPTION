Description: This R package provides a unified modeling toolkit for ensemble learning, bagging and statistical model building. 
    It offers functionalities for fitting various models (linear, logistic, lasso, ridge, elastic net) 
    and machine learning models (random forest) to both binary and continuous response variables. 
    The package supports preprocessing of data, including feature selection, handling missing values, and outlier removal. 
    It also includes options for model tuning, bagging, and ensemble learning techniques to enhance model performance.
